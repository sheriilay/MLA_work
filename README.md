# Real-Time ASL Alphabet Sign Language Translation System

Welcome to the Real-Time ASL Alphabet Sign Language Translation System repository! This project aims to develop a robust framework for real-time hand gesture recognition and translation into text and speech, with a primary focus on enhancing communication accessibility for individuals with speech disabilities, specifically targeting deaf and mute individuals.

## Project Overview
This project leverages computer vision techniques and deep learning algorithms to accurately recognize and interpret hand gestures captured through a webcam or similar device. The system seamlessly translates recognized gestures into both text and speech formats in real-time, enabling effective communication for individuals with speech disabilities.

## Key Features
Real-Time Gesture Recognition: Capture live video feed through a webcam and process hand gestures in real-time.
Deep Learning Integration: Utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for accurate and efficient hand gesture recognition.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Integrate NLP algorithms to translate recognized gestures into text and speech.
User-Friendly Interface: Implement a user-friendly interface for intuitive interaction and feedback.
Performance Evaluation: Evaluate the system's performance through quantitative metrics such as accuracy, speed, and robustness.
